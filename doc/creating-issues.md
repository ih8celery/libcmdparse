## Before you create an issue

read all the available documentation and search the issues, if there
are any. once you are certain your issue has not been covered, feel
free to bring it up.

# How to format your issue

please, provide context! what were you trying to do, how did you attempt
it (with full source), and how did the system respond. please provide
the error message from the exception if there was one. your platform
may be important to your issue, since not all platforms are fully
supported. if you find that some functionality is undocumented or
poorly documented, describe what you think is missing. pull requests
are welcomed.

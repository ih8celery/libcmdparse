### Why don't you capitalize the first word of each sentence?
I find that capital letters are overused in most communication,
particularly in Software Engineering, where capitalization is
sometimes an element of language design. to me, first-word
capitalization is unnecessary and undesirable language boilerplate
that contributes a little to sentence transitions while subtracting
from the impact of Other Capitalized Words. some may argue that
boldface and italics help to resolve such issues, but like the
accretion of new syntax in aging programming languages, such bandaid-
style solutions do NOTHING to correct those fundamental problems.
when most documents were handwritten, the first-word rule was a
sensible one; but now that rule seems pointless outside of a few
situations.

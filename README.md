OptParser

version: .01 (not working)

this project may be seen to imitate existing tools. that impression would
be correct. the purpose of OptParser is to experiment with C++ while doing 
something which is (suprisingly) useful in that same language: command-line
argument processing. this project is done solely for my educational benefit,
and all constructive criticism is welcomed.
